Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
LA LA LA
-------------------------------
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

Branching and merge
